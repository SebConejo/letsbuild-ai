# Let's Build AI

Welcome to the GitHub repository for Let's Build AI - a community-driven platform dedicated to sharing resources, tools, and knowledge for AI enthusiasts and developers. 

## Contributing

We encourage contributions from everyone! Here are some ways you can contribute:

- **Add New Links**: Create a Markdown file under `site/content/{category}/` with the link details.
- **Add New Categories**: If a link does not fit an existing category, new categories can be added in `site/etc/categories.json`.
- **Improve Existing Listings**: Enhancements, updates, or corrections to current listings are always welcome.
- **Feedback and Suggestions**: Share your ideas on how we can improve the platform.

### Guidelines
We seek projects that stand out due to their popularity, dedication from their contributors, or their unique approach to solving problems within the AI space.

Our focus is on adding open-source tools and resources that foster community growth and learning.

We typically exclude closed-source tools or service-only offerings, unless they're unparalleled leaders in their domain without viable open-source alternatives.
